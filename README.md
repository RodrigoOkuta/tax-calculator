This project was created using create-react-app.

Unfortunately, I do not have extensive experience using jest and enzyme. I have more experience testing Node.Js. However I tried my best to include some tests. I am willing to learn and improve my testing in the front-end.

To set up the application you just need to run "npm install"

To start the application, please run "npm start"

To test the application, please run "npm run test"
